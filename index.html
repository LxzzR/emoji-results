          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            My cohort is a resilient and diverse group of ambitious code nerds.
            We were one of the first Juno College cohorts affected by covid and
            our entire curriculum was moved online unexpectedly &ndash; but we
            weren't going to let that stop us! We were all there to change our
            lives and¬†we were ready to work hard. I couldn't be more proud to
            have graduated alongside them.
          </p>

        <!-- === Challenge === -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Learning to code is tough, really tough, and Bootcamp is a pretty
            intense way to learn to code! Not to mention in the middle of a
            pandemic where people's personal lives are also being deeply
            affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a core group of us who were quite vocal about being
            available for anyone who might need peer support. Despite our
            efforts, we discovered through an in-class survey that many of our
            peers were not only struggling but suffering in silence and feeling
            unsure who to reach out to.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are in this together! We're here for you!" came our usual
            chorus. But clearly, our approach wasn't working for those who
            really needed it.
          </p>

        <!-- === Solution === -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            I realized that our broad invitations for support might have been
            too vague for those struggling to ask for help. How could we be more
            explicit so our peers would know these offers were sincere?
          </p>
          <p>
            I came up with an emoji system and presented it to the class the
            next day. Students could add an emoji to their Slack name to
            indicate their current availability to provide emotional support.
            You'll never have to worry that you're bothering someone!

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            After graduation, I created a google survey to get feedback on the
            success of the emoji support system. 12 people responded, with mixed
            numbers of responses per question. I got some great suggestions,
            like how more leadership from the instructors may have been helpful
            in cultivating more buy-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most interesting to me was that only 12% of people felt that they
            were able to provide the kind of support peers were seeking from
            them, but 100% of respondents said that their peers excelled at
            providing them with the support they needed!

              I think sharing the roles of support giver and seeker actually
              ends up helping both parties more than they realize. I was reached
              out to by someone seeking support, and after I offered it, I ended
              up opening up about something that I ended up feeling like I
              needed support on.</q
